Totient
=======

Totient is a peer-to-peer file sharing project based on [bittorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/),
is built using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) to connect things and [ZMQPP](https://github.com/zeromq/zmqpp) to make this easier.

The project just have two components, [nodes](http://github.com/pin3da/totient/tree/master/doc/node.md) and
[trackers](http://github.com/pin3da/totient/tree/master/doc/node.md). Nodes and trackers are connected in a
non-restricted way, so if you want to connect to the Totient cloud you just need to know one tracker's address.
